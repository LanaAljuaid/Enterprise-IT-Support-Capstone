"""
Agent 1: Ticket Intake Agent
============================
Reads the raw employee-reported issue and extracts structured fields.
Identifies missing information and drafts follow-up questions only when
something needed for diagnosis is genuinely missing.

Note: `department` is intentionally NOT extracted here. The employee is
assumed to already be authenticated, and their department is looked up
separately from the internal user database before this agent ever runs.
